A starting list of MCP tools to build into the plugin itself. Beyond built-in MCP tools, should also incorporate some easy way for users to add in their own custom MCP tools (unsure yet whether these need to be always externally run vs at least some subset of things could be implemented/run directly from within Obsidian).

## Built-in

- read_note - parameter to include/exclude frontmatter (default exclude), uses Obsidian's API
- write_note - uses Obsidian's API to write out / edit note contents
- Give it some easy way to directly run commands on the shell (needs to be compatible across OSes). Unsure whether this is MCP-like vs some simpler thing in Cline, so need to research that a bit.
