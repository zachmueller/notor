# Context: attachments, auto-context, and compaction

## Attach notes and files to your messages

You can provide the AI with specific content directly — no `read_note` tool call required:

- **Vault note attachment** — click the attachment button or type `[[` in the chat input to open the file picker with fuzzy autocomplete. Supports section-level references (`[[Note#Section]]`) that include only the content of that heading.
- **External file attachment** — attach text files from outside your vault via the OS-native file dialog.
- **Attachment chips** — attached items appear as labeled chips in the input area before sending. Each chip can be individually removed. Attachments are deduplicated silently.
- **Graceful failures** — if an attached note is deleted or renamed after the chip is added, the message still sends without that attachment and an inline warning is shown.
- Attachment contents are embedded in the message context sent to the LLM but are not rendered in full in the chat thread (chips only).

## Ambient workspace context (auto-context)

Every message automatically includes a snapshot of your current workspace state in the system prompt — no manual effort required:

- **Open note paths** — the vault-relative paths of all notes currently open in any tab, including pinned tabs and split panes. The currently active note is marked `(active)`.
- **Vault structure** — top-level folder names at the vault root (no recursive listing, no individual file names).
- **Operating system** — your OS platform (macOS, Windows, or Linux), so the AI generates platform-appropriate shell commands without asking.

Each source can be individually enabled or disabled in **Settings → Notor**. All three are on by default.

## Auto-compaction for long sessions

When a conversation approaches the active model's context window limit, Notor automatically summarizes it and continues in a new context window:

- The compaction threshold is configurable (default: 80% of the model's context window). Token usage is estimated locally — no provider API call is made.
- While summarization is in progress, a "Compacting context…" indicator appears inline in the chat thread. Chat input remains enabled.
- Once complete, the indicator is replaced by a permanent **Context compacted** marker showing the timestamp and token count at compaction.
- The AI continues seamlessly. The full conversation history is always retained in the JSONL log; compaction only affects what is sent to the LLM.
- The compaction system prompt has a built-in default and can be overridden in **Settings → Notor**.
- Manual compaction is available via the command palette (**Notor: Compact context**).
